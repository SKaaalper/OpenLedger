## Additional Manual Steps

Although most processes are automated, some steps require your intervention. Below is a detailed instruction for performing these actions.

### a. Setting VNC Password

After starting the VNC server, follow these steps:

1. **Enter VNC Password:** Create a strong password using special characters.
2. **Answer the View-Only Password Prompt:** Enter `n`.

### b. Connecting to VNC

1. **Use a VNC Client** on your computer.
2. **Enter Your Server's IP Address with Port `5901`:** For example, `192.168.1.100:5901`.
3. **Enter the VNC Password** you set earlier.

### c. Configuring VNC When Facing Issues with Port `5901`

If you encounter problems connecting to port `5901`, perform the following steps:

1. **Stop the VNC Server:**
    ```bash
    vncserver -kill :1
    ```
2. **Start the VNC Server Without Localization:**
    ```bash
    vncserver :1 -localhost no -geometry 1920x1080 -depth 24
    ```
3. **Attempt to Connect to VNC Again.**

    - Navigate to **Applications â†’ Terminal**.
2. **Start `tmux`:**

    ```bash
    openledger-node --no-sandbox
    ```
4. **Authorization:**
    - **Log in** using your email.
    - Click the **Install** button, then **Connect**.
    - If the **Connect** button does not work (remains yellow), you may need to change the ports.
